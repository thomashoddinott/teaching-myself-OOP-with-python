In this tutorial we learn how to define and instantiate classes using the helpful demo of polygons ([./shapes.py](./shapes.py)).

We cover also cover class methods, default keyword arguments, inheritance & subclassing, class method overriding, and operator overloading ([./point.py](./point.py))

**Why use classes?**

- bug resistant
- easy to understand
- ready to change
